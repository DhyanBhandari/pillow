Sleep Monitoring System Enhancement: Adding Relaxation Music
After analyzing your project, I understand you want to enhance the sleep monitoring pillow by adding functionality to play relaxation music when a user is having trouble sleeping.
Project Analysis
Your current system:

Monitors heart rate and sleep positions (Left, Mid, Right)
Uses a KNN classifier to categorize sleep states into 9 categories
Detects sleep issues categorized as "Danger-LeftSleep", "Danger-MidSleep", or "Danger-RightSleep"
Outputs classifications but doesn't take automated actions to help users sleep

Implementation Strategy
I'll create a new Python script that will:

Monitor the sleep state classifications
Detect when a user is having trouble sleeping (Danger states)
Play relaxation music to help them sleep better
Stop the music when sleep normalizes

How It Works

Initialization:

Loads the trained pillow model
Sets up pygame for audio playback
Creates a directory for relaxation music if it doesn't exist


Music Management:

Plays relaxation music when the user has difficulty sleeping
Automatically stops music when sleep normalizes
Supports various audio formats (.mp3, .wav)


Sleep Monitoring:

Continuously reads from the input file
Predicts sleep state using the trained model
Maintains a history of recent states to avoid reacting to brief fluctuations


Smart Triggering:

Requires 3 consecutive danger readings before playing music
Requires 5 consecutive normal readings before stopping music



Setup Instructions

Save the script as sleep_monitor.py in your project directory
Create a music folder:
mkdir relaxation_music

Add relaxation music files:

Add .mp3 or .wav relaxation music to the relaxation_music folder
You can find free relaxation music on sites like freesound.org or similar resources


Install required libraries:
pip install numpy pygame scikit-learn joblib

Run the script:
python sleep_monitor.py


The script will monitor the input file and automatically play relaxation music when it detects the user is having trouble sleeping (in "Danger" states). It will stop the music when the sleep state normalizes.
You can customize the sensitivity by adjusting the consecutive count thresholds in the code.

The project appears to be monitoring sleep patterns using a pillow device that collects data about heart rate and sleep positions. The system uses a machine learning model to classify sleep states and can now play relaxation music when it detects sleep issues.
Let me create a comprehensive README based on this information.Smart Sleep Monitoring System with Music Therapy
Overview
The Smart Sleep Monitoring System is an IoT-based solution that monitors your sleep patterns, detects sleep issues, and automatically plays relaxation music to help you achieve better sleep. The system uses sensors embedded in a pillow to track heart rate and sleep positions, and employs machine learning to classify sleep states and take appropriate actions.
Features

Real-time monitoring of heart rate and sleep positions (Left, Mid, Right)
Advanced sleep state classification (Normal, Danger, Snore states)
Automatic relaxation music playback when sleep difficulties are detected
Sleep quality tracking and reporting
Data storage with blockchain integration for security

Implementation
Hardware Requirements

Smart pillow with pressure sensors
Heart rate monitoring sensor
Microcontroller (Arduino/Raspberry Pi)
Speaker system for music playback

Software Components

Data Collection Module

Collects sensor data from the pillow
Formats data for processing


Sleep State Classification System

Trained KNN model (Pillow_model.pkl)
Classifies sleep into 9 distinct states:

Danger-LeftSleep, Danger-MidSleep, Danger-RightSleep
Normal-LeftSleep, Normal-MidSleep, Normal-RightSleep
Snore-LeftSleep, Snore-MidSleep, Snore-RightSleep




Music Therapy Module

Monitors sleep states continuously
Activates when "Danger" states are detected for extended periods
Plays calming music to aid sleep
Automatically stops when sleep normalizes


Blockchain Integration

Secure storage of sleep data
Patient privacy protection



# Setup Instructions
1. Install Dependencies
# bashpip install numpy pandas scikit-learn joblib pygame
2. Prepare Music Files
# Create a directory named relaxation_music and add .mp3 or .wav files:
bashmkdir relaxation_music
# Copy your relaxation music files to this folder
3. Run the Sleep Monitor
# bashpython sleep_monitor.py
Usage
Monitoring Sleep

Connect the smart pillow sensors to your system
Ensure the system is receiving data in the correct format
The system will automatically:

Monitor sleep states
Log classifications to output files
Play music when sleep issues are detected
Stop music when sleep normalizes



Data Format
# Input data should be formatted as four numeric values separated by #:
[Heart_Beat]#[Left_Sleep]#[Mid_Sleep]#[Right_Sleep]
# Example:

# Sleep State Interpretation

Danger States: Indicate difficulty falling asleep or sleep disruption
Normal States: Indicate healthy sleep patterns
Snore States: Indicate potential breathing issues during sleep
